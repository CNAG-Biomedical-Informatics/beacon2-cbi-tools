# NAME

bff-validator: A script that validates metadata (XLSX|JSON) against Beacon v2 Models and serializes them to BFF (JSON)

# SYNOPSIS

    bff-validator -i <file.xlsx|*.json> [-options]

      Arguments:
        -i | --input <file.xlsx|*.json>   Metadata xlsx file or *.json files

      Options:
        -s | --schema-dir <directory>     Directory with JSON schemas (must have JSON pointers de-referenced)
        -o | --out-dir <directory>        Output (existing) directory for the BFF files (only to be used if input is XLSX)
        -gv                               Set this option if you want to process <genomicVariations> entity
        -ignore-validation                Writes JSON collection regardless of results from validation against JSON schemas (AYOR!)

      Experimental:
        -gv-vcf                           Set this option to read <genomicVariations.json> from <beacon vcf> (with one document per line)

        -debug <level>                    Print debugging information (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the max)
        -verbose                          Enable verbosity
        -nc | --no-color                  Do not print colors to STDOUT
        -ne | --no-emoji                  Do not print emojis to STDOUT

# SUMMARY

bff-validator: A tool for validating datasets against the Beacon v2 schema.

\- **Purpose:** Ensures that submitted data conforms to the Beacon v2 model schema.

\- **Key Features:**
  - Provides a template Excel input file
  - Also accepts JSON as input
  - Schema validation for data integrity
  - Detects structural and format inconsistencies
  - Essential for data ingestion workflows

# INSTALLATION

If you got this script from `beacon2-cbi-tools` no action is required from you.

If you want to install ONLY this script then:

The script runs on command-line Linux (tested on Debian-based distribution). Perl 5 is installed by default on Linux,
but we will need to install a few CPAN modules.

First we install cpanminus (with sudo privileges):

    $ sudo apt-get install cpanminus

Second we use cpanm to install the CPAN modules:

First you need to copy the following [cpanfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrueda/beacon2-cbi-tools/main/cpanfile) to your current directory.  You have two choose between one of the 2 options below:

**Option 1:** System-level installation:

    cpanm --notest --sudo --installdeps .

**Option 2:** Install the dependencies at `~/perl5`

    cpanm --local-lib=~/perl5 local::lib && eval $(perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5/ -Mlocal::lib)
    cpanm --notest --installdeps .

To ensure Perl recognizes your local modules every time you start a new terminal, you should type:

    echo 'eval $(perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5/ -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc

Also, we're using _xlsx2csv_, which is a python script.

    $ pip install xlsx2csv

# HOW TO RUN BFF-VALIDATOR

    <!--how-to-run-start-->

For executing `bff-validator` you will need:

- Input file:

    You have two options:

    **A)** A XLSX file consisting of multiple sheets. A [template](https://metacpan.org/pod/Beacon-v2-Models_template.xlsx) version of this file is provided with this installation.

    Currently, the file consists of 7 sheets that match the Beacon v2 Models.

    Please use the flag `--gv` should you want to validate the data in the sheet &lt;genomicVariations>.

    _NB:_ If you have multiple CSV files instead of a XLSX file you can use the included utility [csv2xlsx](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-cbi-tools/blob/main/utils/models2xlsx/csv2xlsx) that will join all CSVs into 1 XLSX.

        $ ./csv2xlsx *csv -o out.xlsx

    **B)** A set of JSON (array) files that follow the Beacon Friendly Format. The files MUST be uncompressed and named &lt;analyses.json>, &lt;biosamples.json>, etc.

- Beacon v2 Models (with JSON pointers dereferenced)

    You should have them at `deref_schemas` directory.

**Examples:**

     $ ./bff-validator -i file.xlsx

     $ $path/bff-validator -i file.xlsx -o my_bff_outdir

     $ $path/bff-validator -i my_bff_in_dir/*json -s deref_schemas -o my_bff_out_dir 

     $ $path/bff-validator -i file.xlsx --gv --schema-dir deref_schemas --out-dir my_bff_out_dir
    

## TIPS ON FILLING OUT THE EXCEL TEMPLATE

    * Please, before filling in any field, check out the provided template for ../../CINECA_synthetic_cohort_EUROPE_UK1/*xlsx
    * The script accepts Unicode characters (encoded with utf-8)
    * Header fields: 
       - Dots ('.') represent objects: 
           Examples (values):
             1 - foo
             2 - NCIT:C20197
             3 - true # booleans
             4 - ["foo","bar","baz"] # arrays are also allowed
       - Underscores ('_') represent arrays: 
           * Up to 1D (e.g., individuals->measures_assyCode.id) the values are comma separated
              Examples (values):
               1 - measures_assayCode.id
                   LOINC:35925-4,LOINC:3141-9,LOINC:8308-9
                  measures_assayCode.label
                   BMI,Weight,Height-standing
                   
           * Others - Values for array fields start with '[' and end with ']'
              Examples (values): 
               1 - ["foo":{"bar": "baz"}}]
               2 - ["foo","bar","baz"]

## COMMON ERRORS AND SOLUTIONS

    * Error message: , or } expected while parsing object/hash, at character offset 574 (before "]")
      Solution: Make sure you have the right amount of opening or closing keys/brackets.

_NB:_ You can use the flag `--ignore-validation` and check the temporary files at `-o` directory.
