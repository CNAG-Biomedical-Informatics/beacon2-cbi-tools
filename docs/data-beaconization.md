# Tutorial (Data "beaconization")

In this tutorial it is expected to already have the Data ingestion tools downloaded, installed and set up following the instructions in [Installation](download-and-installation/docker-based.md).

Let's start by the simplest case. Imagine that you have:

  * **Metadata** (including phenotypic data) in your system, labelled according to your internal nomenclature.
  *  A **VCF** file.

## Previous steps

#### Connect to the container

The beacon2-cbi-tools container is running in detached mode or in the background. To connect, you should invoke from your terminal:

```bash
docker exec -ti beacon2-cbi-tools bash
```
Now you should be inside the `beacon2-cbi-tools` container to start the Data beaconization.

## STEP 1

First, we are going to convert your metadata (sequencing methodology, bioinformatics tools, phenotypic data, etc.) to the format of the [Beacon v2 Models](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/schemas-md/analyses_defaultSchema). As **input**, we will be using this [XLSX](https://github.com/mrueda/beacon2-cbi-tools/blob/main/utils/bff_validator/Beacon-v2-Models_template.xlsx) template.

!!! Important "About the XLSX template"
    The XLSX template consists of **seven sheets** that match the [Beacon v2 Models](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/).
    The template has the purpose of facilitating users' transformation of the data (likely in tabular form) to the hierarchical structure that we have in the [Beacon v2 Models](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/schemas-md/analyses_defaultSchema).
    The header nomenclature gives a hint about if the data will be later stored as an `object` (naming contains `.`) or as an `array` (naming contains `_`).
    Each column has its own format (e.g., string, date, [CURIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE)). These formats can browsed in the [documentation](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/schemas-md/analyses_defaultSchema). 
    We recommend using the provided XLSX for the [synthetic data](https://github.com/mrueda/beacon2-cbi-tools/blob/main/CINECA_synthetic_cohort_EUROPE_UK1/Beacon-v2-Models_CINECA_UK1.xlsx) as a reference.

The first thing you need to do is **manually map/convert your metadata** to match the syntax of the provided [XLSX file](https://github.com/mrueda/beacon2-cbi-tools/blob/main/utils/bff_validator/Beacon-v2-Models_template.xlsx), ensuring you fill it out accurately.

![Excel template](img/excel-template.png)


!!! Warning "Note"
    Normally, people don't fill out the sheet (tab) named `genomicVariations` as this info will be taken from the annotated VCF (see STEP 2).

Once you have completed filling out the Excel file, you can proceed to validate it. At this stage, it’s common to have uncertainties about your mapping to Beacon v2 syntax. Luckily, the B2RI utility `bff-validator` is there to assist you with this task. The validator **ensures that all values in the XLSX file conform to the specifications outlined in the Beacon v2 Models default schemas**. Technically, this process is referred to as _validating data against JSON Schemas_.

```bash
bin/bff-tools validate -i your_xlsx_file.xlsx --out-dir your_bff_dir
```

When you run it, it's highly probable that you'll encounter errors or warnings related to your data. The `bff-tools validate` tool is designed to detect these errors and provide explanations for the validation failures. Please ensure to **address all the issues** within the XLSX file. Feel free to run the script as many times as needed. :-)

??? Warning "Example Errors"

    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Row 1:
    /ethnicity/id: String does not match ^\w[^:]+:.+$.
    ```

    This error indicates that the `id` within `ethnicity` does not conform to the [CURIE convention](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2/blob/main/framework/json/common/beaconCommonComponents.json). The expected format is a string that matches the specified regular expression.
    
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Row 1:
    /id: Missing property.
    ```
    This error suggests that the `id` attribute is missing for the individual in question.
    
    **Example 3: (Non-error)**

    As the specification is currently under development, warnings may appear for fields that appear correct. An example is the `oneOf` [error](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2/issues/49), as shown below:
    
    ```
    Row 1:
    /diseases/0/ageOfOnset: oneOf rules 0, 1 match.
    ```

!!! Danger "About Unicode"
    [Unicode characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) are permitted as values in cells. However, be cautious when copying and pasting from external sources, as this can introduce unexpected characters in unintended places. If the `bff-validator` generates errors that are difficult to diagnose, consider using the `--ignore-validation` flag to proceed and then examine the generated JSON files for errors. After identifying and correcting the errors in the original Excel file, rerun the validation process without the `--ignore-validation` flag. For more detailed information, please visit [this page](https://github.com/mrueda/beacon2-cbi-tools/tree/main/utils/bff_validator).

At some point, you won't encounter any validation errors. By then, the script should have generated 6 text files, which we refer to as the **Beacon Friendly Format**. These files are in **JSON** format (specifically, JSON arrays) and will be utilized later in **STEP 3**.

![BFF validator](img/bff-tools-validate.png)

Congratulations! Now you can go to STEP 2.

## STEP 2

Now that you have processed the metadata, it's time to process the **VCF** file.

!!! Important "About VCF types"
    Currently, the B2RI only handles VCFs coming from **DNAseq** experiments (e.g., WES, WGS, gene panels, etc.). The VCFs can be either _single_ or _multisample_. <br />
    As of this writing, **structural variants** in VCF files are not being parsed. (There is a Scout working group currently developing Beacon v2 specifications for structural variants.) We hope to implement this feature in future versions. **Copy Number Variations** are not supported. The `variation` property uses the `LegacyVariation` sub-property.

The VCF file has to be gzipped (or bgzipped). What we are going to do it's to annotate it (or re-annotate it if your file already has annotations) with **SnpEff and SnpSift** and transform the format so that it becames the 7th BFF file (i.e., `genomicVariationsVcf.json`). 

```bash
bin/bff-tools vcf   -t 4       -i input.vcf.gz -p param_file.yaml
     |         |      |         |              |
    exe      mode   #threads   <vcf>           parameters file (optional)
```

Here we are using `bff-tools` script in mode ***vcf***. This mode (subcommand) is one of the five available [vcf|tsv|load|full|validate]. 

The parameters file is optional if you want to use the default value (hg19) but it is needed if you want to change them. Note that you must provide the **reference genome** (unless you're using `hg19` which is the default one) that was used to create your VCF. See all the script options [here](https://github.com/mrueda/beacon2-cbi-tools#how-to-run-beacon).

The `param_file` (`YAML`) should look something like this:

```yaml
---
genome: hs37
```

If you want to create an `HTML` file to be later viewed with the **BFF Browser** utility your `YAML` file should look like this:

```yaml
---
genome: hs37
bff2html: true
```

!!! Important "Note about timing"
    We optimized the script to be as fast as possible for a scripting language. (Update: In 2025, a `Rust` version for `vcf2bff` was created and tested, but it achieved similar speed.) Processing time scales linearly with the number of variants, but is also influenced by the number of samples. For example, annotating and processing 1 million variants across 2,500 samples takes approximately 20-25 minutes.

If something is wrong with the input files, the script will complain and provide [possible solutions](https://b2ri-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/#data-ingestion-tools).

![Beacon to VCF](img/bff-tools-vcf.png)

Once completed, you will end up with a dir like this one `beacon_XXXXXXX/vcf`. Inside, you will find `genomicVariationsVcf.json.gz`, the 7th BFF file.

!!! Warning "About disk usage"
    During the annotation process, **multiple intermediate VCF files are created (and kept)**. They're all compressed, but still they will be **as big as your original VCF**. On top of that, `genomicVariationsVcf.json.gz` file can be huge. In summary, **please allocate up to 10x times the space of your original VCF**. Feel free to erase the temporary VCF files `beacon_XXXXXXX/vcf/*vcf.gz` once the job is completed.

Now that you have the 7 JSON files it's time to go to the STEP 3.

## STEP 3

The objective of this step is to load (a.k.a. ingest) the 7 JSON files into **MongoDB**. Once loaded in MongoDB, they are named **collections**.

For doing this we will use again `bff-tools` script, but this time in mode `load`.

Let's assume that we have the 6 files from STEP 1 in the directory `my_bff_dir` and the file from STEP 2 at `beacon_XXXXXXX`. 

We will add these values to a new parameters (YAML) file:

```yaml
---
bff:
  metadatadir: my_bff_dir
  # You can change the name of the JSON files
  runs: runs.json
  cohorts: cohorts.json
  biosamples: biosamples.json
  individuals: individuals.json
  analyses: analyses.json
  datasets: datasets.json
  # Note that genomicVariationsVcf is not affected by <metadatadir>
  genomicVariationsVcf: beacon_XXXXXXX/vcf/genomicVariationsVcf.json.gz
```

Finally, you execute this command

```bash
bin/bff-tools load -p param_file.yaml
       |       |        |
      exe     mode     paramaters file
```

If everything goes well, all your data should be loaded into an instance of MongoDB.

!!! Warning "Note"
    To exit this container you just need to type "exit".


!!! Hint "Using `mongoimport` for data ingestion"
    
    As mentioned in STEP 3, the `bff-tools` script in `load` mode is responsible for loading the data (**ingestion** and **indexing**) in MongoDB. You can view the detailed indexing process executed by `beacon2-cbi-tools` [here](https://github.com/mrueda/beacon2-cbi-tools/blob/main/BEACON/bin/run_bff2mongodb.sh). The system utilizes both **single field** and **text** indices. Notably, when new data is introduced to MongoDB, the existing indexes are automatically updated to include this new data.

    If you choose to handle data ingestion personally using a CLI tool, the `beacon2-cbi-tools` container provides the MongoDB utility `mongoimport` for this purpose. Below is an example of how to execute it:

    ```bash
    mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file analyses.json --collection analyses 
    mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file biosamples.json --collection biosamples 
    mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file cohorts.json --collection cohorts 
    mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file datasets.json --collection datasets 
    mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file individuals.json --collection individuals 
    mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file runs.json --collection runs 
    mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file genomicVariationsVcf.json --collection genomicVariations   
    ```

    Again, remember that if you follow this alternative path, you will have to **index your MongoDB data**. Indexes can affect the performance of your Beacon v2 API.

!!! Important "Note about MongoDB"
    As with any other database, it is possible to perform queries directly to **MongoDB**. In our case, the database is named _beacon_ and contains the ingested _collections_. For doing so, you will need to use one of the many UI (we have included **Mongo Express**), the `mongosh` (also included) or use any of the [MongoDB drivers](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers) that exist for most programming languages. As an example, we have included an utility `bff-portal` that enables you to make **simple queries** (see instructions [here](https://github.com/mrueda/beacon2-cbi-tools/tree/main/utils/bff_portal)). For a more comprehensive description check [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) literature.
